## 📊 How It Works

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Dataset Loading**: Reads CSV/Excel files into pandas DataFrame

2. **Basic Statistics**: Calculates rows, columns, memory usage, feature types

3. **Data Quality Analysis**:
   - Missing value detection and percentage
   - Duplicate row identification
   - Data completeness metrics

4. **Feature Analysis**:
   - Numeric feature statistics (skewness, kurtosis, variance)
   - Categorical feature cardinality
   - Feature correlation analysis
   - High correlation pair detection

5. **Target Variable Analysis** (if provided):
   - Task type detection (classification vs regression)

   - Regression metrics (mean, std, skewness, etc.)

6. **Complexity Metrics**:
   - Feature-to-sample ratio
   - Dimensionality assessment
   - Overall complexity score

7. **Algorithm Scoring**:
   - Each algorithm is scored based on dataset characteristics
   - Multiple factors contribute to the score:
     - Sample size compatibility
     - Feature count handling
     - Missing data tolerance
     - Feature type support
     - Task-specific capabilities
   - Confidence is calculated based on matching criteria

8. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Algorithms are ranked by score
   - Top recommendations are displayed with full details
   - Visualizations show score distributions

## 🎨 Algorithm Selection Criteria

The system considers:

- **Dataset Size**: Small (<1K), Medium (1K-100K), Large (>100K)
- **Feature Count**: Low (<10), Medium (10-50), High (>50)
- **Missing Data**: Percentage and handling requirements
- **Feature Types**: Numeric vs categorical balance
- **Target Characteristics**: 
  - Classification: Number of classes, class imbalance
  - Regression: Distribution, skewness, variance

## 💡 Tips

1. **For best results**: Provide a target column if you have one - this enables more accurate task type detection
2. **Large datasets**: The analysis may take a moment - be patient for comprehensive results
3. **Missing data**: Algorithms that handle missing data natively (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) score higher when missing data is present
4. **Feature engineering**: Review the preliminary recommendations for feature engineering suggestions
